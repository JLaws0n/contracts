Top DoD contract recipients 2001-2003: the tip of the iceberg
-------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since my first encounter with In-Q-Tel (CIA's venture capital arm) 
representatives interested in investing in my adviser's copmany, and with a
mathematician from Lockheed Martin who told me and my Chinese national 
labmates, "Lockheed needs to see that we can put this thing on the front of a
missile," I have been fascinated with the system of Department of Defense 
contracting and spending. Ever more important now, with regular government 
shut-downs, debt ceiling crises, and a widening gap between the poor and wealthy
in the United States, we must understand how our government spends money. This
the first of a series of posts in which I explore the structure of the 
DoD contract system.

In the most recent issue of Mother Jones, there is an article on the 
extraordinary 'peacetime' level of spending that we will indefinitely 
be at following the drawdown and retreat from Afghanistan. The very first graph
shows the peaks and valleys of military spending at different times in 
recent (WWII and after) history. WWII remains the most spendy time in DoD 
history. However, currently, the military spends on credit that has not apparently
been explicitly approved by lawmakers. It's also my hypothesis that much of the
spending currently underway is not actually for items of immediate use, but
instead on high-tech gadgetry, machinery, and weaponry, that won't necessarily
make us more safe, but will enrich the companies whose business it is to develop
such technologies.

Below, we look at the top five contract dollar amount recipients from the 
pivotal period January, 2001, to December, 2013. We look at just how much money
was promised these companies by the DoD in total, as well as the daily 
accumulation of contract money. As seen in the Mother Jones plot, spending 
increases after 9/11. But questions abound, such as, did the frequency of 
awarded contracts increase post-9/11 or did the dollar amounts go up? Which 
companies saw the highest increase in contract awards both in dollars and 
percentage. These questions will be answered in this post. Other questions to
be answered later include, which projects contributed most to the increase in
spending, what is the role of university research, and if taxpayers were venture
capitalist investors putting their money towards 'high-risk' research, which 
is what was happening in my graduate research lab, how much would the return
on the investment be?
